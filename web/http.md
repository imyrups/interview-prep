# ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Transport Layer

### ‚úÖ **HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2**:

* Built on **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.
* Reliable but suffers from **head-of-line (HOL) blocking**: if one packet is delayed, others behind it are stuck.

### ‚úÖ **HTTP/3**:

* Built on **UDP** using the **QUIC** protocol.
* QUIC is user-space and avoids kernel overhead.
* Handles multiplexed streams **independently**: no TCP-level HOL blocking.

# üîÑ 2. Multiplexing

| Feature   | HTTP/1.1                                | HTTP/2                                 | HTTP/3                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Mechanism | One request/response per TCP connection | Multiple streams in one TCP connection | Streams over QUIC (independent) |
| Issue     | Workarounds like domain sharding        | TCP HOL blocking                       | No TCP, no HOL blocking         |

---

# üóÇÔ∏è 3. Headers

* **HTTP/1.1**: Text headers, redundant, large.
* **HTTP/2**: Binary headers compressed with **HPACK**.
* **HTTP/3**: More efficient header compression using **QPACK**, designed to work over QUIC‚Äôs stream model.

# üîê 4. Encryption (TLS)

| Protocol | Encryption           | Notes                             |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| HTTP/1.1 | Optional (HTTPS)     | HTTP and HTTPS are both common    |
| HTTP/2   | Practically required | Browsers only support it over TLS |
| HTTP/3   | **Mandatory**        | QUIC includes TLS 1.3 natively    |

* **HTTP/3 integrates TLS** directly into QUIC ‚Äî fewer round trips and improved security posture.

| Latency                   | High (multiple handshakes) | Lower with multiplexing             | Lowest with 0-RTT handshakes         |
| Throughput                | Lower                      | Higher (binary, compressed headers) | Highest (no HOL, fast reconnection)  |
| Resilience to Packet Loss | Poor                       | Poor (TCP HOL blocking)             | Excellent (QUIC stream independence) |
| Connection Resumption     | Full TLS resumption        | Full TLS resumption                 | **0-RTT resumed instantly**          |

## ‚úÖ TL;DR Recommendations

* Use **HTTP/2** as the default today ‚Äî it's stable, supported, and provides big gains over HTTP/1.1.
* Use **HTTP/3** if:

  * You're optimizing for **mobile or high-latency** networks.
  * You're using **CDNs** that support it (e.g., Cloudflare).
  * You want **future-proofing** and **0-RTT** connection reuse.
