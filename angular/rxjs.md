# üîÅ **Operators & Streams**

1. **What is the difference between `mergeMap`, `switchMap`, `concatMap`, and `exhaustMap`? In which scenarios would you prefer each?**
2. **How would you implement rate limiting or throttling with RxJS?**

# ‚öôÔ∏è **Architecture & Design**

16. **How would you design an event-driven system with RxJS that reacts to multiple user and server actions?**
17. **Describe a scenario where you used RxJS to orchestrate multiple asynchronous operations conditionally.**
18. **How do you modularize and test complex RxJS logic in a large codebase?**
19. **Have you ever implemented a custom RxJS operator? What was the need and approach?**
20. **What are the pros and cons of using `rxjs/fetch` over native `fetch` wrapped in `from`?**

22. **How do you handle cascading API calls using RxJS (e.g., dependent requests)?**
23. **Describe a bug related to race conditions in an RxJS stream that you‚Äôve encountered and solved.**
24. **What precautions do you take when sharing observables across components or services?**
25. **Can you explain a real-world scenario where using RxJS saved significant development time or complexity?**
