## üì¶ State Management Concepts

1. Explain how NgRx handles state immutability and what benefits it brings to large-scale applications.
  In NgRx, state immutability means that once a state object is created, it is never modified directly. Instead, any change to the state results in the creation of a new object (or part of the object), with the updated values.
  NgRx enforces immutability by design:
  - Reducers must be pure functions.
  - State transitions should always return a new state object, never mutate the existing one.
  - NgRx uses Object.assign, object spread ({...}), Array.prototype.slice(), and similar techniques under the hood to copy data.

  Benifits:
  - Predictability & Debugging
  - Undo/Redo & History Tracking
  - Performance with Change Detection
  - Error Reduction
  - Centralized State Debugging
  
2. What are the downsides of using NgRx in a complex application?
 
  
3. How would you structure state in a large application with 50+ feature modules?  
4. What are selectors, and how do you optimize them for performance?  
5. What is the difference between `createFeatureSelector` and `createSelector`?

## üîç NgRx Store Internals

6. How does NgRx `Store` differ from a regular `BehaviorSubject`?  
7. How does Angular change detection interact with NgRx state updates?  
8. What are meta-reducers and when should they be used?  
9. How does NgRx handle lazy-loaded modules with feature states?  
10. How does NgRx DevTools implement time-travel debugging?

## ‚öôÔ∏è NgRx Effects & Side Effects

11. Explain the lifecycle of an NgRx effect and its interaction with dispatched actions.  
12. What are the risks of dispatching multiple actions from a single effect?  
13. Compare `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, and `exhaustMap` in NgRx Effects.  
14. How do you handle silent or unhandled effect failures?  
15. How would you implement global error handling across all effects?

---

## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Patterns & Architecture

16. How would you implement optimistic updates and rollback logic?  
17. What is `@ngrx/entity`, and what are the trade-offs of using it?  
18. Why would you implement a custom router state serializer?  
19. How can you prevent over-fetching or duplicate API calls in NgRx?  
20. How would you implement a global loading/error state mechanism using NgRx?

## üß™ Testing & Maintainability

21. How do you test selectors and effects in NgRx?  
22. How would you refactor a bloated feature module with excessive reducer logic?  
23. What is an NgRx facade pattern? What are its pros and cons?  
24. How do you handle versioned state migrations (e.g., schema changes in app state)?

---

## üß© Real-World Scenarios

25. How would you implement offline support in an NgRx-driven app?  
26. How would you sync real-time collaborative state with WebSockets and NgRx?  
27. How do you manage UI logic that depends on multiple slices of state?  
28. How would you migrate from service-based state management to NgRx incrementally?  
29. Describe a performance issue you faced with NgRx and how you solved it.  
30. Share a debugging challenge you encountered with NgRx and how you resolved it.
