### ‚úÖ **React Core and Advanced Concepts**

1. **Explain the React reconciliation process. How does React decide what to re-render?**
2. **How do you manage complex state across deeply nested components? What‚Äôs your approach for scalability?**
3. **What are React concurrent features? Have you used concurrent mode or Suspense for data fetching?**
4. **How would you architect a component that needs to update every animation frame (e.g., for live game stats)?**
5. **Describe your experience with React performance profiling. How do you identify and fix bottlenecks?**

### üéÆ **Gaming/Product-Oriented UI Challenges**

6. **How would you implement a real-time leaderboard with thousands of players updating per second?**
7. **Have you worked with WebSockets or real-time updates in React? How did you manage it efficiently?**
8. **How would you handle animations in React for game elements (e.g., characters, score counters)?**
9. **What rendering limitations have you faced with React in a game-like UI? How did you overcome them?**
10. **Have you ever integrated Three.js, WebGL, or Canvas inside a React app? What challenges did you face?**

### üîÅ **State Management & Architecture**

11. **Compare Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and Recoil for managing game-related state. When would you choose each?**
12. **How do you handle state synchronization between UI and backend in a multiplayer game environment?**
13. **What‚Äôs your strategy for persisting and rehydrating game session state (e.g., on reload)?**
14. **Describe an instance where you refactored a legacy state management system in a large React app.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance, Testing, and Optimization**

15. **What techniques do you use to reduce re-renders in large React applications?**
16. **How do you use memoization (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) wisely?**
17. **How do you test UI that is highly dynamic and depends on real-time game events?**
18. **Describe your process of load testing or simulating high user interaction in a React-based game dashboard.**

### üß† **System Design & Team Collaboration**

19. **Design a modular React architecture for a gaming dashboard with chat, leaderboard, and live game feed.**
20. **How do you approach component design to enable design system or theme customization for game skins?**
21. **What challenges have you faced working with designers on rapidly changing gaming UIs?**

### üß© **Bonus: Algorithmic / Creative**

22. **Write a React hook that throttles updates to a component rendering a real-time score.**
23. **Describe an elegant way to implement a countdown timer with pause/resume/reset functionality.**
24. **How would you animate a circular progress bar for a timed game event using React and CSS/Canvas?**
