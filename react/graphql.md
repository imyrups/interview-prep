## 📐 Schema Design & Best Practices

- How do you handle versioning in GraphQL APIs?
- What are unions and interfaces in GraphQL? When would you use one over the other?
- How would you model polymorphic relationships in GraphQL?
- Explain the difference between input types and object types.
- What are custom scalars, and when would you use them?

---

## 🔄 Resolvers & Execution Flow

- Describe the lifecycle of a GraphQL request.
- What are resolver chains, and how can you avoid the N+1 problem?
- How do you optimize resolver performance for deeply nested queries?
- Can resolvers return Promises? How does GraphQL handle async logic?
- How do you implement middleware logic (e.g., logging, auth) for resolvers?

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- How would you implement field-level authorization in GraphQL?
- Compare schema directives vs. middleware for handling authorization.
- How do you protect a public GraphQL API from malicious or complex queries?

---

## 🚀 Performance & Optimization

- What is DataLoader and how does it help solve the N+1 problem?
- What are persisted queries and how do they help performance?
- How would you cache GraphQL responses (server-side and client-side)?
- What is query complexity analysis and depth limiting? How is it implemented?

---

## 🧰 Tooling & Ecosystem

- What is Apollo Federation? How does it enable GraphQL microservices?
- What are GraphQL subscriptions and how do you implement real-time updates?
- How does Apollo Client's cache work and how can you customize it?

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

- How do you test GraphQL resolvers and queries?
- What tools do you use for monitoring and debugging GraphQL APIs?
- How do you mock GraphQL queries for frontend testing?

---

## 🔗 Integration & Migration

- How would you integrate GraphQL into an existing REST-based infrastructure?
- What are the common challenges when migrating from REST to GraphQL?
