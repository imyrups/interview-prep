# Interview Questions

## Sapient
- What are error boundaries and how is that implemented?
- What is suspense? Can it work with Apis calls as well for fallback or loading?
- What is the use of useRef?
- What are the patterns used in react, RenderProp, Container..?

### Code:
- Create a table of pokemon, one api will return list and url, hit urls for each item and add abilities and show name and abilities (join them) in table
  Hint useReducer, promise.all(to reduce render cycles)

- Create a counter updates every sec from 0 to 10 & 10 to 0 infinitely
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [multiplier, setMultiplier] = useState(1);
  useEffect(() => {
    const int = setInterval(() => {
      if (counter === 0) {
        setMultiplier(1);
      } else if (counter === 10) {
        setMultiplier(-1);
      } else {
        setCounter(counter + multiplier);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(int);
  }, [counter, multiplier]);

  return <p>Counter: {counter}</p>;
};

export default Counter;
```
- Create a custom useState Hook. Asked if we could use other hook like useReducer or anything -> No
```js
  
  const useState1 = (initialState) => {
  let state = intialState;
  function setState(newState) {
    if (typeof newState === "function") {
      state = newState(state);
    } else {
      state = newState;
    }
  }

  return [state, setState];
};

useState1(0);

tried using classbased first
class useState1 {
  setState(newState) {
    this.state = newState;
  }
  constructor(initialState) {
    this.state = initialState;

    return [this.state, this.setState];
  }
}

```
## Design an app where we need the filter compo based on (source, assets, tags), implemented in real time
### How do you store and process millions of records on UI
### How do you batch rendering as the data coming from web scoets every 100ms
### How do you handle error failure cases in your socket
### If you reconnect to socket , how do you handle duplication issue
### is there no way on UI to handle a million records
### how would virtualisation work if we have blocks with variable lengths, say description is of 1 line in one vs 4 line in other?


# GlobalLogic
- What are some of the most used hooks in react
- What are synthetic events?
- Do we need to do event delegation with say list comp or we can attach event listener to each item?
- What are the ways that you could optimise the react performance?
- what is the diff between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?
- How do you share state between two remote apps in MFE?

## Why do you see the old react project importing react mandatorily

```js
import React from 'react';
```
is due to how **JSX (JavaScript XML)** was compiled **before React 17**.

---

## üèõÔ∏è React Before Version 17 (Pre-2020)

When you wrote JSX like:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;
```

The compiler (Babel, for example) **transpiled** it to:

```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello');
```

This means:

* You **had to import `React`** in any file that used JSX.
* Otherwise, you'd get a **ReferenceError**: `React is not defined`.

So even if you didn‚Äôt explicitly use `React`, you had to import it because JSX depended on `React.createElement`.

---

## üöÄ React 17 and Newer: JSX Transform

Starting in **React 17**, the React team introduced the **"new JSX transform"**, which does **not require `React` to be in scope** anymore.

Now, JSX compiles to something like:

```js
import { jsx as _jsx } from 'react/jsx-runtime';

const element = _jsx('h1', { children: 'Hello' });
```

So now, unless you‚Äôre directly using `React` (like for `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), you **don‚Äôt need to import it**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| React Version | Required `import React` for JSX? | Why?                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| < 17          | ‚úÖ Yes                            | JSX compiled to `React.createElement` |
| ‚â• 17          | ‚ùå No                             | New JSX transform using `jsx-runtime` |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Opt In to the New Transform

Most modern tools like **Create React App**, **Vite**, and **Next.js** use the new JSX transform by default. If you're using Babel directly, you'd need:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/preset-react", { "runtime": "automatic" }]
  ]
}
```
