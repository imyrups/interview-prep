## âœ… **Key Areas of Focus**

### 1. **React.js Deep Dive**

* React internals: reconciliation, virtual DOM, fiber architecture.
* Advanced hooks: `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, custom hooks.
* Performance optimization: lazy loading, memoization, code splitting.
* Component design patterns: HOC, render props, compound components.
* State management: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, or Context API.

**Sample Questions:**

* How does Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm work?
* How would you handle performance issues in a large React application?
* Can you explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

---

### 2. **System Design for Frontend**

* Designing scalable and maintainable frontend architecture.
* Micro frontends, monorepos, or modular codebases.
* Code-splitting strategies and webpack optimizations.
* CI/CD for frontend, versioning, feature flags.

**Sample Scenarios:**

* Design a dashboard with real-time data updates and role-based access.
* Build a component library for multiple products.
* How would you design a system to support A/B testing?

---

### 3. **JavaScript/TypeScript Mastery**

* Deep understanding of JS concepts (closures, event loop, async/await).
* TypeScript: generics, utility types, type guards.
* Error handling and debugging.

---

### 4. **Leadership & Team Collaboration**

* Mentoring junior developers.
* Making tech decisions: trade-offs between frameworks/libraries.
* Agile processes, code reviews, handling tech debt.

**Questions might include:**

* How do you ensure high code quality across a team?
* Have you ever had to push back against a product decision for technical reasons?

---

### 5. **Product Thinking**

* Understanding of UX and user flows.
* Balancing MVP features with scalable code.
* Communication with design/product teams.

---

## ðŸ”§ **Preparation Tips**

* Review your past projects: architecture decisions, challenges, and trade-offs.
* Practice a few real-world frontend system design problems.
* Brush up on TS + React patterns.
* Prepare to talk about scaling teams and projects.
* Be ready for hands-on coding (e.g., building a reusable component or solving a bug).
