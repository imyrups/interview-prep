## Designing `Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)` in a `React` application involves managing user permissions based on their assigned roles. Here's a guide to implement it cleanly:

---

### üîê Core Concepts of RBAC

1. **Users**: People who log in to your app.
2. **Roles**: Sets of permissions (e.g., "admin", "editor", "viewer").
3. **Permissions**: Specific access rights (e.g., "edit-post", "view-dashboard").

---

### üß± General Architecture

#### 1. **Define Roles and Permissions**

You can define them in a config file or a backend service.

```js
// roles.js
export const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: 'admin',
  EDITOR: 'editor',
  VIEWER: 'viewer',
};

export const PERMISSIONS = {
  'admin': ['view_dashboard', 'edit_post', 'delete_post'],
  'editor': ['view_dashboard', 'edit_post'],
  'viewer': ['view_dashboard'],
};
```

---

#### 2. **Store User Role in Auth Context**

Use a global state (e.g., React Context, Redux) to track logged-in user info.

```js
// AuthContext.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ role: 'viewer' }); // Example default

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```

---

#### 3. **Create a Permission Check Utility**

```js
import { PERMISSIONS } from './roles';

export const hasPermission = (role, permission) => {
  return PERMISSIONS[role]?.includes(permission);
};
```

---

#### 4. **Create a Role-Based Route or Component Wrapper**

```jsx
// ProtectedRoute.js
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
import { hasPermission } from './permissionUtils';

const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, requiredPermission }) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  if (!hasPermission(user.role, requiredPermission)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }

  return children;
};

export default ProtectedRoute;
```

Usage:

```jsx
<ProtectedRoute requiredPermission="edit_post">
  <EditPostPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

---

#### 5. **Control UI Elements (e.g., Buttons, Links)**

```jsx
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
import { hasPermission } from './permissionUtils';

const EditButton = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  if (!hasPermission(user.role, 'edit_post')) return null;

  return <button>Edit</button>;
};
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Enhancements

* Integrate with backend-auth (JWTs, OAuth, etc.)
* Fetch roles/permissions from the backend
* Use React Router's `<Outlet>` and `<Routes>` for nested RBAC
* Memoize permission checks for performance

Absolutely! Here's a comprehensive guide to implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in a **React** application, complete with a working example and visual aids.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing RBAC in React

### 1. **Define Roles and Permissions**

Start by defining your roles and the associated permissions. This can be done in a separate file for clarity.

```javascript
// roles.js
export const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: 'admin',
  EDITOR: 'editor',
  VIEWER: 'viewer',
};

export const PERMISSIONS = {
  CREATE_POST: 'create-post',
  EDIT_POST: 'edit-post',
  DELETE_POST: 'delete-post',
  VIEW_DASHBOARD: 'view-dashboard',
};
```

### 2. **Set Up Authentication Context**

Create a context to manage user authentication and roles across your application.

```javascript
// AuthContext.js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ role: 'viewer' });

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```

### 3. **Implement Protected Routes**

Create a component to protect routes based on user permissions.

```javascript
// ProtectedRoute.js
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
import { PERMISSIONS } from './roles';

const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, requiredPermission }) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  if (!user.permissions.includes(requiredPermission)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }

  return children;
};

export default ProtectedRoute;
```

### 4. **Control UI Elements Based on Permissions**

Render UI elements conditionally based on user permissions.

```javascript
// EditButton.js
import { useAuth } from './AuthContext';
import { PERMISSIONS } from './roles';

const EditButton = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  if (!user.permissions.includes(PERMISSIONS.EDIT_POST)) return null;

  return <button>Edit Post</button>;
};

export default EditButton;
```

### 5. **Integrate with React Router**

Ensure that your routes are protected using the `ProtectedRoute` component.

```javascript
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import { AuthProvider } from './AuthContext';
import ProtectedRoute from './ProtectedRoute';
import EditButton from './EditButton';

const App = () => (
  <AuthProvider>
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/edit" element={<ProtectedRoute requiredPermission="edit-post"><EditButton /></ProtectedRoute>} />
        {/* Other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  </AuthProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## TechnoMangerial
For an **L3 React Lead** role in a multinational corporation (MNC), the interview questions should focus on **technical leadership, team management, and handling complex scenarios**. Here's a list of advanced **techno-managerial questions** that would be appropriate for such an interview:

---

### **1. Sprint Planning and Execution**

**Q1: How do you approach sprint planning when working with a cross-functional team? How do you balance technical debt with new feature development?**

* **Why:** This checks the candidate's ability to plan a sprint while considering both immediate goals and long-term technical health.
* **Follow-up:** How do you ensure the team adheres to the sprint goals while balancing the need for code quality?

Absolutely ‚Äî let's take these **techno-managerial questions** one by one, and I‚Äôll walk you through each with a **detailed explanation and example** for better understanding. We'll start with the **first one**:

---

## ‚úÖ **1. How do you approach sprint planning when working with a cross-functional team? How do you balance technical debt with new feature development?**

### üîç **Why this question matters:**

This tests your **ability to lead the team** through the planning phase of the agile cycle while managing trade-offs. As a React Lead, you're expected to balance product expectations, frontend development velocity, and architectural soundness.

---

### üéØ **What to Cover in Your Answer:**

1. **Stakeholder Alignment:**

   * Start by syncing with Product Owners to understand business priorities.
   * Confirm scope and align expectations.

2. **Technical Assessment:**

   * Review codebase to check areas that need refactoring or contain technical debt.
   * Discuss with developers to surface pain points that should be addressed.

3. **Task Breakdown:**

   * Divide features into manageable stories and tasks.
   * Identify dependencies (e.g., backend APIs) and parallelizable work.

4. **Effort Estimation:**

   * Use story points or time-based estimates, with the team‚Äôs input.

5. **Debt vs Features:**

   * Propose a fixed timebox in each sprint (e.g., 15‚Äì20%) for tech debt.
   * Prioritize high-impact debt or blockers that slow down development.

6. **Final Plan & Communication:**

   * Present the sprint plan in a planning meeting.
   * Set achievable goals and ensure the team commits to the right amount of work.

---

### üìò **Example Answer:**

> "In my last project at a fintech MNC, our cross-functional team included React devs, backend devs, QA, and a product owner. During sprint planning, we first reviewed the business goals with the PO and selected the top priorities from the backlog.
>
> We then did a technical grooming session where developers flagged two areas with legacy code causing UI performance issues. I proposed we allocate 20% of the sprint for refactoring those parts while still delivering two high-priority features.
>
> We used story points to estimate tasks, discussed risks (e.g., incomplete APIs from backend), and adjusted the scope accordingly. By doing this, we avoided burnout, tackled long-standing technical debt, and still met sprint goals. I also ensured this balance was documented and shared in the sprint review to maintain transparency with stakeholders."
