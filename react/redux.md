## üîÅ **Advanced Redux Interview Questions (8+ Years Experience)**

### **Architecture & Design**

1. **Explain the Redux data flow. How does it differ from Flux?**
2. **Why is Redux considered a predictable state container?**
3. **What are the trade-offs of using Redux over local state or Context API?**
4. **How would you structure a large-scale Redux application?**
5. **How do you manage modular Redux in a micro-frontend architecture?**
6. **Explain the role of `combineReducers`. Can you write a custom version of it?**

---

### **Middleware & Side Effects**

7. **How does Redux middleware work? Can you write a custom middleware to log actions or handle async logic?**
8. **Compare Redux Thunk vs Redux Saga vs Redux Observable. When would you choose one over another?**
9. **How does the middleware chain work internally? What happens if you change the order of middlewares?**
10. **Explain how Redux Saga handles side effects. Can you describe the effect creators (`call`, `put`, `takeEvery`, etc.)?**

---

### **Performance Optimization**

11. **What causes performance issues in Redux apps? How do you avoid unnecessary re-renders?**
12. **How does memoization (e.g., `reselect`) improve Redux performance?**
13. **What is the impact of deeply nested reducers? How do you manage and optimize them?**
14. **How can you batch Redux state updates to improve performance?**
15. **How do you profile Redux performance bottlenecks?**

---

### **Testing**

16. **How do you test reducers, middleware, and async action creators?**
17. **What are some best practices for testing Redux Sagas or Thunks?**
18. **How would you mock the Redux store for unit or integration tests?**

---

### **Integration & Tooling**

19. **How would you integrate Redux into a non-React project (e.g., vanilla JS or Angular)?**
20. **How does Redux DevTools work under the hood?**
21. **What is `redux-persist` and when would you use it?**
22. **Can you explain how time-travel debugging is possible with Redux?**
23. **How would you handle server-side rendering (SSR) with Redux and React?**

---

### **Advanced Concepts**

24. **What are some common anti-patterns in Redux applications?**
25. **What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic updates in Redux?**
26. **How would you manage undo/redo functionality using Redux?**
27. **How would you handle concurrent edits in a collaborative Redux app?**
28. **Explain Redux Toolkit. What problems does it solve?**
29. **Why is immutability important in Redux, and how do you enforce it?**
30. **Can you implement a middleware that enforces immutability?**

---

### **Bonus: Live Coding / System Design Prompts**

* **Build a simplified Redux-like store from scratch.**
* **Design a real-time chat application using Redux, WebSockets, and middleware.**
* **Implement a undo/redo mechanism using Redux.**
* **Refactor a complex reducer using Redux Toolkit.**
